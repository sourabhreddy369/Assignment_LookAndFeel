            Since President Obama took office, Congress has appropriated more than $4 billion
            to help turn around the nation's lowest-performing schools. States were awarded
            nearly $3.5 billion in School Improvement Grant funds in 2010 to turn around their
            persistently lowest achieving schools. School districts then applied to state for
            the funds this spring. When school districts applied, they were required to indicate
            that they would implement one of the following four models in their persistently lowest achieving schools
        </p>
        <p style="margin-left:30px">
            On December 3, 2009, U.S. Secretary of Education Arne Duncan announced the final requirements for
            $3.5 billion in Title I School Improvement Grants (SIGs) to turn around the nation’s lowest
            performing schools. The applications were due into the U.S. Department of Education by Feb. 8, 2010.
            These funds were made available to states by formula and competed for by school districts.
            As they competed for the funds, school districts/local educational agencies (LEAs) were
            required to identify the schools they wanted to transform, and then determine which of
            four models was most appropriate: the turnaround model, the restart model, school closure,
            or the transformation model. The law delineates the requirements for each of the four models.
            If a school had begun implementation of one of these four models or components of one of
            these models within the previous two years, it was permitted to apply to use SIG funds to
            continue to implement the full model.
